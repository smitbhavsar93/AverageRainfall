## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop any of these .c files into a c programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Geany. 
Next, replace the "path" aka the "FILE* ptr = fopen("text2.dat" , "r");" line of code and change the text file to any file of your choice, just make 
sure it is a .txt or .dat file and voila! Code will be able to run.

## Geany
