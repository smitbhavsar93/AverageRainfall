# AverageRainfall
My final term project for my first-year university digital computation and programming club. The aim of the program was to read in a text file of 6 columns and a maximum of 256 rows and output multiple different pieces of information. Each separate program does something unique, so go ahead and knock yourself out!

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop any of these .c files into a c programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Geany. 
Next, replace the "path" aka the "FILE* ptr = fopen("text2.dat" , "r");" line of code and change the text file to any file of your choice, just make 
sure it is a .txt or .dat file and voila! Code will be able to run.

## Geany
This program was coded on Geany, to download Geany, visit : https://www.geany.org/download/releases/ and download their latest release on your compatible device.
